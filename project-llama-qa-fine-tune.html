            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, I fine-tuned the LLaMA 3.1 70B-Instruct model on a custom RV (Recreational Vehicle) dataset. The goal was to create a specialized model capable of answering detailed questions about various RV models, their features, and specifications.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <h3>Challenge 1: Limited Computational Resources</h3>
            <p>Fine-tuning a 70B parameter model requires significant computational power. To overcome this, I implemented several optimization techniques:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Used 4-bit quantization to reduce memory usage</li>
                <li>Implemented LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning</li>
                <li>Utilized Unsloth for optimized training, reducing VRAM usage by 30%</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenge 2: Custom Dataset Formatting</h3>
            <p>The RV dataset needed specific formatting for effective fine-tuning. I created a custom formatting function to prepare the data:</p>
            <pre><code>
def formatting_prompts_func(examples):
    questions = examples["Question"]
    answers = examples["Answer"]
    texts = []
    for question, answer in zip(questions, answers):
        text = alpaca_prompt.format(question, answer) + EOS_TOKEN
        texts.append(text)
    return {"text": texts}
            </code></pre>
