            <h2>Situation</h2>
            <p>As a well-known top player in the Counter-Strike: Source (CS:S) surfing community (known as TUCKS), I've set numerous world records and frequently coach new players. However, with a recent surge in player count, it became impossible to manually guide every newcomer individually.</p>

        <section id="task" class="project-section">
            <h2>Task</h2>
            <p>Develop AI-driven tools to assist new players in improving their surfing skills and to answer common questions about CS:S surfing techniques. The goal was to create a scalable solution that could provide instant guidance to the growing community.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="action" class="project-section">
            <h2>Action</h2>
            <p>I developed two interconnected AI tools to address the community's needs:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Surfing Chatbot</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a custom Discord scraper to collect chat data from the KSF community Discord.</li>
                <li>Preprocessed and cleaned the collected data to create a high-quality training dataset.</li>
                <li>Developed and trained a natural language processing model to understand and respond to surfing-related queries.</li>
                <li>Implemented the chatbot with a user-friendly interface for easy access by new players.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Surfing Optimization Tool</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Collected gameplay data and footage from both world record runs and typical player runs.</li>
                <li>Developed a computer vision model to analyze surfing techniques from gameplay footage.</li>
                <li>Created a data processing pipeline to extract relevant metrics from gameplay data.</li>
                <li>Implemented a comparison algorithm to identify areas for improvement by comparing player runs to world record runs.</li>
                <li>Designed a feedback system to provide actionable insights to players for optimizing their runs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Details</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Discord Scraper: Custom Python script using Discord API</li>
                <li>Chatbot Model: BERT-based model fine-tuned on surfing community data</li>
                <li>Computer Vision: CNN for analyzing player movements and techniques</li>
                <li>Data Processing: Python with NumPy and Pandas for metric extraction and analysis</li>
                <li>Optimization Algorithm: Custom algorithm comparing run metrics and identifying improvement areas</li>
                <li>User Interface: Web-based dashboard for both chatbot and optimization tool</li>
            </ul>

            <div id="model-architecture-chart"></div>
        </section>

        <section id="result" class="project-section">
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>The CS:S Surfing AI Tools have significantly improved the learning experience for new players and helped intermediate players optimize their techniques:</p>
            
            <div class="result-stats">
                <h3>Performance Improvements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>*still gathering data on this one</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The tools have been widely adopted by the CS:S surfing community, allowing new players to get instant guidance and experienced players to fine-tune their techniques. This has led to a more engaged and skilled player base, contributing to the growth and competitiveness of the surfing community.</p>
