        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Llama 3.1 QA Fine-tune:</strong> Fine-tuned the LLaMA 3.1 70B-Instruct model on a custom RV dataset, requested by an RV company. Implemented advanced fine-tuning techniques and deployed the model to Hugging Face Hub.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-driven tool for Counter-Strike: Source Surfing:</strong> Developed a Discord bot for data collection and cleaning. Integrated the Mistral-7B-v1.0 model for context-aware responses and used 4-bit quantization to optimize data processing. Implemented OCR with Pytesseract and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for gameplay analysis and performance improvement suggestions.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-GPU Fine Tuning LLM:</strong> Fine-tuned a large language model using a multi-GPU setup with Deepspeed and LoRA. Configured mixed precision with bf16, gradient checkpointing, and 4-bit quantization. Managed training with custom datasets and applied FlashAttention for efficiency. Deployed and uploaded the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face Hub.</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Theft Analysis with Machine Learning Algorithms:</strong> Cleaned and processed a dataset of stolen vehicles, applying supervised algorithms (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) and unsupervised methods (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) for pattern discovery. Developed heuristic visualizations and a PowerPoint presentation for board meetings.</li>
